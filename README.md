##  2. Expose Local Server via Ngrok

### a. Install `ngrok`:

Download from: https://ngrok.com/download

### b. Add your authtoken:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN>
```

> Get your authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

### c. Start a tunnel on port `5000`:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Copy the `https` forwarding URL shown, e.g.:

```
Forwarding https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

You'll use this for the webhook:  
```
https://abc123.ngrok.io/incoming-sms
```

##  3. Start the Webhook Server

Make sure you have Python ‚â• 3.8 and `pip` installed.

### a. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### b. Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root with the following:

```env
DEVICE_IP=10.35.xxx.xxx
DEVICE_PORT=8080
APP_USERNAME=username 
PASSWORD=password
NGROK_URL=nrgok_url
AI_ENDPOINT=ai_agent_url
```

### c. Start the Quart server using Uvicorn

#### For Linux/macOS:

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
uvicorn app:app --host ${HOST:-0.0.0.0} --port ${PORT:-5000}
```

#### For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

##  4. Register the Webhook URL

With the server running and `ngrok` active run the `webhook.py` file

---

##  Notes

-  **Ensure mobile & laptop are on the same local network.**
-  **Capcom6 SMS Gateway works only with SMS/MMS and does not support RCS chat.**
-  Use `.env` to securely manage environment variables.
-  Use `ngrok` HTTPS URL (not HTTP or local IP) for external webhook registration.
